# Dynamic Experiments for Estimating Preferences (DEEP)

In trying to understand choices, people would like to know the decision maker's underlying preferences. DEEP is a novel methodology to elicit individuals' risk and time preferences by dynamically (i.e., adaptively) optimizing the sequences of questions presented to each subject, while leveraging information about the distribution of the parameters across individuals (heterogeneity) and modeling response error explicitly. Basically, here are how these preferences determine the utility perceived by subjects in DEEP:
